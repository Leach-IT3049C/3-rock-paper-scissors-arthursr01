## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I had a good start but then it was minute detail that had me stuck for hours on end, anymore than I should have, though besides that it works 20/20
## Self-Reflection:
Overall I had an ok time doing this assignment, I had the big problem that had an easy fix but really I just need to learn to scan the code for any descrepancies. Though I think I did a good job overall.

### How long it took me to finish this?
8 hours
